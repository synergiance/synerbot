## Synerbot

This is a relatively simple IRC bot designed soully for the purpose
of connecting to an IRC channel, and doing whatever I say. I will work
on updating it, sort of slowly, but surely.

##### Project Status

Synerbot hasn't been actively maintained in the past 4 years, so I will
be calling it a dead project for now.  When I get around to it, I would
like to address a few bugs that exist here, but as of right now, I don't
have the time to invest in synerbot.

##### Building

Just type `make` in the terminal. Makefile will take care of the rest.
Please note: You need clang or version 4.9 of the GNU Compiler. Earlier
versions do not support regex and synerbot will crash.

##### Debugging

All bug reports go to Synergiance.
